<ExampleDescription>This is a low-level response. Pronunciation is a particular problem for the speaker. Several key words and phrases are unclear. This requires considerable listener effort and, at times, causes some confusion about meaning. The speaker is very slow getting started and he makes numerous false starts. Eventually, he is able to talk about some of the key information from the reading and listening material but he struggles to convey the information correctly.</ExampleDescription>
